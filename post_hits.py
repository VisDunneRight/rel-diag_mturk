Workers should be familiar with SQL at the level of an advanced undergraduate database class, in particular with nested SQL queries. The HIT is composed of 32 multiple choices questions that ask the user to find the correct description of an SQL query based on a text or visual representation. To successfully complete the HIT, you need to answer at least 16 questions correctly within 40 minutes. You receive bonuses if you get more correct answers and/or finish in shorter time. For more details, click on Preview to view the full instructions of the HIT. Please contact us with any questions or issues, especially if you get a 'Your HIT submission was not successful' error message."
